## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

## My process

This is my first Read.me file ðŸŽ‰ It is a great tool for remembering my process and resources.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### Surprises

- Hero title - it was a bit more challenging than I thought it would be - what with spans and breaks combined with making the site responsive.

- Spent time on what to call the CSS classes. Still not entirely happy with the result...next time...

### Code snippets

Here is my favorite code sample for this project:

```css
.submit-btn {
  position: absolute;
  transform: translateX(-3em);
}
```

Learned how to change the color of the placeholder text:

```css
::placeholder {
  color: var(--desaturated-red);
  opacity: 0.5;
}
```

In order to remove the glowing blue border around the email, I wrote below. There must be a better way - but this will do -- for now:

```css
input:focus,
textarea {
  outline: none !important;
}
```

### CSS tips

For responsive sites and CSS tips, Kevin Powell is the go-to expert. Here's a snippet of some of his tips that I considered while working through this project:

- **Avoid height whenever possible. Websites are naturally responsive.** Consider using the padding property instead. Also, checkout Kevin's em vs rem lesson: [em vs rem](https://youtu.be/_-aDOAMmDHI)

- Youtube episode about
  [rems (-> in relation to root/html) instead of ems for fontsizes, as ems cause compounding problems. Use ems for margin and padding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pautqDqa54I)

Josh W Comeau also has a good solution for how to work with about [rems](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/surprising-truth-about-pixels-and-accessibility/#the-625-trick). I considered using his suggestion for this coding challenge -- but will keep it in mind for future projects instead.

### Interesting Articles

- [MDN article on the picture element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture) - This helped me when I needed to use a mobile version img vs a differently cropped image for desktop.
- [MDN article on overflow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow) - Good reminder about the overflow property.

- [Validating email address in JS](https://ui.dev/validate-email-address-javascript)
  Short and sweet JS code for validating email addresses.
