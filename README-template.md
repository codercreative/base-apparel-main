## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

## My process

This is my first Read.me file ðŸŽ‰ It is a great tool for remembering my process and resources.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

A short recap of my major learnings.

For responsive sites and CSS tips, Kevin Powell is the go-to expert. Here's a snippet of some of his tips that I considered while working through this project:

- **Avoid height and width whenever possible.** Naturally, websites are responsive. Consider using the padding property instead.

Here are my favorite code samples for this project:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

Love ðŸ’• how this simple code snippet centers things:

```css
.body {
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

- Need more indepth study of how to place images on a responsive website

### Useful resources

- [MDN article on the picture element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture) - This helped me when I needed to use a mobile version img vs a differently cropped image for desktop.
- [MDN article on overflow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow) - Good reminder about the overflow property.

- [Validating email address in JS](https://ui.dev/validate-email-address-javascript)
  Short and sweet JS code for validating email addresses.
